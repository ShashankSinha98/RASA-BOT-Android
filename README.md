I have made a simple chat application which sends user message to RASA server, and sends response back to user - both text and image. There are 2 main parts:


- RASA Model
- Chat App


<br />

## What is RASA ?

RASA is an Open-Source machine learning framework for building contextual AI assistants and chatbots. It Consists of 2 components â€“ 
1.	Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
2.	Dialogue Management aka Core

<br />

NLU: Ear of assistant. Help assistant to understand what is being said. It Takes user input in an unstructured human language and extract structured data in form of intents and entities.

<br />

Dialogue Management (Core):  -	Brain of Assistant.	Makes decision of how an assistant should respond based on specific state of conversation as well as context. -	Core learns by observing patterns from conversational data between user and Assistant (aka stories).


<br />


## Rasa install and setup

1. open/create virtual-env and activate it

2. <i>pip install rasa</i>

3. cd to project dir

4. <i>rasa init</i> - It will setup initial rasa project named Mood bot

5. For training model- <i>rasa train</i>

6. For running model- <i>rasa shell</i>


<br />

## Expose Rasa server

1. open virtual-env and cd to project dir

2. <i>rasa train</i>

3. <i>rasa run -m models --enable-api --endpoints endpoints.yml</i> - note the port no of local host

4. open ngrok and type- <i>ngrok http PORT-NO</i> (eg- ngrok http 5005)

5. copy https link - base url for making request from android app

<br />

## Testing Rasa Server on Postman

1. Open postman

2. Make POST request to - NGROK-HTTPS-URL/webhooks/rest/webhook. (eg- https://5ea1-2405-201-4029-66-6812-2e4d-93-e9e1.ngrok.io/webhooks/rest/webhook)

3. Select Body, choose raw and input data in JSON format. 

eg- {
    "sender": "shashank",
    "message":"how are you"
})

4. click send and observer response.

## Chat App

I used retrofit inside my chat app to make POST request to RASA server and display response to user. I have used MVVM architecture to better organize my project and handle configuration changes. There are 3 types of views used in recycler view of chat conversation:

1. user message
2. bot message
3. bot loading message

#### Libraries used - 
- Retrofit
- Gson
- Glide
- ViewModel
- Material Design
