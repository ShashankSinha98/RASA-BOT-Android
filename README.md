I have made a simple chat application which sends user message to RASA server, and sends response back to user - both text and image. There are 2 main parts:


- RASA Model
- Chat App


<br />

## What is RASA ?

RASA is an Open-Source machine learning framework for building contextual AI assistants and chatbots. It Consists of 2 components â€“ 
1.	Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
2.	Dialogue Management aka Core

<br />

NLU: Ear of assistant. Help assistant to understand what is being said. It Takes user input in an unstructured human language and extract structured data in form of intents and entities.

<br />

Dialogue Management (Core):  -	Brain of Assistant.	Makes decision of how an assistant should respond based on specific state of conversation as well as context. -	Core learns by observing patterns from conversational data between user and Assistant (aka stories).
